# TimeSlot

I’ve built Timeslot, a tool to manage and schedule meetings effortlessly.

With Timeslot, you can create and display available time slots on your personalized booking page (e.g., https://timeslot-ten.vercel.app/nitintwt27). Customers can view your availability, book slots, and receive email notifications with Google Meet links. The tool also integrates with Google Calendar, automatically adding events to your schedule.

You can easily track your upcoming, available, and past slots, as well as cancel any bookings with automatic email notifications to your customers. Additionally, the dashboard provides insights into customer data, total earnings, and the number of slots you’ve managed.

Additionally, Timeslot is designed to scale with your business, making it an ideal solution for freelancers and small businesses looking to streamline their scheduling process.

To get started, you only need to do two things after logging in:

First, on the dashboard page, connect your Google account so that we can generate Google Meet links and create events in your Google Calendar. 

Second, create your unique username, which will be used to identify your booking page. 

After that, you’re all set to use the service.
